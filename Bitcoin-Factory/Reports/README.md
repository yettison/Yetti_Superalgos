# Bitcoin Factory Reports
This directory includes Bitcoin Factory report files, used to determine Bitcoin Factory Governance rewards.

Operators of reward-providing servers should commit their report files into this directory after the end of each month, including all eligible transactions which have occurred during the previous calendar month. You do not need to exclude transactions of the current month when uploading files, the Governance system will exclude these automatically. However, each transaction should only be reflected in exactly one file uploaded to this directory - the same transaction must not be reflected in two different files.

## Rewards for Test Case Execution
Required file name pattern: __Testnet*.csv__
