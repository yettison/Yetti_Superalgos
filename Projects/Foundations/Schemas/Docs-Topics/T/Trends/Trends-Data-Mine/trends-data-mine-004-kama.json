What the KAMA indicator aims to do is filter out 'market noise': insignificant, temporary surges in price action. One of the primary weaknesses of traditional moving averages is that when used for trading signals, they tend to generate many false signals. The KAMA indicator seeks to lessen this tendency - generate fewer false signals - by not responding to short-term, insignificant price movements.",
