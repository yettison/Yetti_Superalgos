Especially for someone like me who isn't super firm in coding, contributing etc. For instance, I was writing a very detailed review, saved it with docs.save but in the end all was gone. Makes you furious. Nevertheless, looking forward to dig deeper and maybe help making the tool more accessible for noobs like me."
