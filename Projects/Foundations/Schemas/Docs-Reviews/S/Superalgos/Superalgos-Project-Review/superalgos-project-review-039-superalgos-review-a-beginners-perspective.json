For a new user, the ammount of features demands you to spend quite some quality time with the platform - in the end, you are planning to trade your hard earned cash. \nThe tutorials are very well written, the documentation is vast and the ammount of shared experertize is amazing. It is by far the most collaborative effort I see in the trading space.",
